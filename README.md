# First-Unity-Game
Final Project for a game design course taken in college. Developed in a team with 2 other classmates: [Jiri Hoffmann](https://github.com/JiriHoffmann) and [Gabriel Gunnink](https://github.com/lazeromlet)
<br>The main goal of the project for class was to make a small game demo in unity that utilized a handful of c# scripts
- We had 3 weeks to design and build the game. 
- Our initial idea was to make a 2d game and we were aiming for one that played and felt similar to Super Metroid and games in the Metroidvania genre.
- The game features multiple side-scroller type levels with a player character moving along fighting enemies and avoiding enemy projectiles.
- Assets for the Characters, Animations, Environment, and Enemies were all obtained through free assets off the unity store.
- Original Assets: HUD items (Health Bars and back up health), Sounds for shooting, explosions, and the boss level music.


I plan to make a video demo of the game and include it here in the near future.
